# I was Wrong: State of Working with Documents

Turns out CV has gotten much better working with documents and extracting structure than
I was aware. After some research I found several research documents and eventually APIs
that did, to varying extents, what I would want in an [ideal document format]().

There are several commercial APIs that I was not aware of at the time, mostly
because I didn't know the task was refered to as "document layout analysis". After
using that keyword I was able to find papers, discords, and eventually azure and amazon
apis.
