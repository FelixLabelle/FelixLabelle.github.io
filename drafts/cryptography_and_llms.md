I've thought of two ways of using LLMs

Improved LLMs make it easier to recover  hidden messages. You can use them to optimize for likely texts

However improved LLMs can make it easier to hide messages as well. Here are two thoughts I had

1) Using LLMs to create false paths through an existing cryptographic approach (e.g., steganography)
2) Using LLMs to generate a text that has a handful of points, but
