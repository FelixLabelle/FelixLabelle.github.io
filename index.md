Welcome to Profoundly Mundane! This blog discusses engineering in the context of Natural Language Processing (NLP). While the amount of resources and information available has greatly increased within the last few years, many 'simple' subjects remain under-discussed. This makes it hard to understand the trade-offs when selecting NLP methods, unlike more established engineering fields. The goal of this blog is to explore the hidden depth within the seemingly mundane aspects of NLP and make understanding the different design choices more accessible.
